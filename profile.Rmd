## Introduction

###### My name is Charles Ross and I'm a GIS Analyst, Data Visualization Specialist, Data Engineer and Data Scientist who specializes in using programs such as ArcGIS, R Shiny, Power BI, and Tableau to create interactive and dynamic dashboards, maps, reports, graphs, tables, and other applications that meets the request of my clients who are either looking for new features to add to an existing platform, or are looking for a new tool to explore information within their own organization. I also specialize in utilizing various coding languages such as Python, R, and SQL to clean and analyze large datasets, streamline data processing workflows, as well as maintain and organize databases.
